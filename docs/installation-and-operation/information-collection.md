# About the anonymous usage data we collect

If you've opted in to provide us with anonymous usage data (thank you!), Metabase will phone home some data collected via Google Analytics and Snowplow.

**We only collect Metabase data; we don't collect any of your data.** We don't collect any usernames, emails, server IPs, database details of any kind, or any personally identifiable information.

The data helps us understand how people are actually using Metabase, which in turn helps us prioritize what to work on next.

## Opting out of anonymous usage data collection

To opt out of providing us with your anonymous usage data:

1. Click on the gear icon.
2. Select **Admin settings**.
3. Go to the **Settings** tab.
4. Click **General**
5. Toggle the **Anonymous tracking** option.

If you're in the process of setting up your Metabase, you can also toggle off tracking during the `Usage Data Preferences` onboarding step. We collect a few anonymous events before that point, but won't do so anymore if you choose to opt out.
